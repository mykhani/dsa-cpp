/*
 * Binary heap data structure is used:
 * 1. To implement Heapsort
 * 2. To implement priority queue
 *
 * It has two types:
 * 1. Min Heap
 * Highest priority item is assigned lowest value
 *
 * 2. Max Heap
 * Highest priority item is assigned highest value
 *
 * Binary Heap is a complete binary tree (stored as an array)
 * A full binary tree is one in which leaf nodes has 0 children and
 * all other nodes have exactly 2 children. In other words, each node has
 * either 0 or 2 children.
 *
 * A complete binary tree is the one which has all levels completely filled
 * and the last level might be incomplete and filled from left to right
 *
 * About storing binary tree as an array, you can think of how inorder, preorder
 * or postorder traversal can also be stored as an array and can be used to
 * represent the tree.
 *
 * The binary heap must be considered as a complete binary tree in order to store
 * it as an array. As the levels are filled left to right, we can predict the indices
 * for the left and right child from the array.
 *
 * for a node i, indices can be found as
 * left = 2*i + 1
 * right = 2*i + 2
 * parent = ceil(i - 1)/2
 *
 * NOTE: A key point to remember is that a heap is an array with special consideration to how elements
 * are indexed i.e. instead of finding elements linearly using consecutive index, use the above
 * left, right and parent index calculation to traverse array. I have created special MinHeap and MaxHeap
 * classes to abstract away the details but you could do even without them and just have functions that
 * operate on arrays like
 *
 * heapify(int arr[], int i, int n)
 * extractMinimum(int arr[], int n)
 * build(int arr[], int n)
 * etc
 *
 * Advantages:
 * 1. Random access (stored as an array) O(1)
 * 2. Cache friendly (locality of reference)
 * 3. Height of tree is minimum possible
 * 4. No space needed for storing left and right pointers
 *
 * Note that binary heap is not necessarily a BST where left is less than root and right is greater than root
 *
 * Min Heap:
 * 1. A complete binary tree
 * 2. Every node has a value smaller than its descendents. So root must be the minimum value

 * 1. Dijkstra Algorithm

/*
 * Priority Queue in C++:
 * A priority queue is always implemented using a heap data structure.
 *
 * Creating a Priority Queue (MaxHeap):
 * #include <queue>
 * std::priority_queue<int> pq; // default is MaxHeap
 *
 * Normal queue functions except highest values always at top
 * pq.top()
 * pq.pop()
 * pq.empty()
 * pq.size()
 *
 * Creating a Priority Queue (MinHeap)
 *
 * std::priority_queue<int, 			// underlying datatype
 *  				   vector<int>, 	// underlying array for implementation (must specify)
 *  				   greater<int>		// comparator
 *  				  > pq;
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * #include <iostream>
 * #include <queue>
 *
 * using namespace std;
 *
 * int main() {
 * 	   using namespace std;
 *
 *     int arr[] {10, 5, 15};
 *     priority_queue<int> pq(arr, arr + 3); // build O(n)
 *      // or
 *     priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> pq2(begin(arr), end(arr));
 *
 *     while (!pq.empty()) {
 *         cout << pq.top() << ", "; // O(1)
 *         pq.pop();                 // O(logn) push is also O(logn)
 *     }
 *
 *     cout << endl;
 *
 *     while (!pq2.empty()) {
 *         cout << pq2.top() << endl;
 *         pq2.pop();
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * Output:
 * 15, 10, 5,
 * 5, 10, 15,
 */

/*
 * If priority queue is created with std::pair<int, int> data type, the first element of the pair
 * is considered for min/max by the default comparators. To override this behavior, provide custom
 * comparators (function objects that overload operator() and return a bool)

// which means that once you fully sort the k-sorted array, the
// item at index i in k-sorted array will be present between indices
// i-k to i+k in the final fully sorted array.
// e.g.
// input[] = {9, 8, 7, 18, 19, 17}, k = 2
